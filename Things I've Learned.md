## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

- Biggest lessons - Javascript. 
  This is my first JS project. I had very basic JS knowledge with no application in the real world prior to this. I used ChatGPT as part of the learning process. Whilst I used stackoverflow and w3schools to find the JS code to create a collapsible element, I did not understand what I was looking at. I used GPT to interrogate the code line by line and gain better understanding of exactly what is happening.
  At first the code seemed beyond my capabilities to understand, in time, I came to realise that it was building on lessons already learned - if statements and for loops. I've learned how and why they are applied in a real world setting.
  
- Prioritisation 
  At first I was focused on the elements that I didn't truly understand. Following advice from a more experienced friend, I built out the content-wrapper and then came back to focus on the areas that I understand. Primarily this was the background image, colour and overlaying the content-wrapper on the background.

- Adding images in-line with strings and as background
  My initial approach had been to put all images into the HTML but I learned of using background images. There was also lessons already opacity and z-index that I had heard of but never utilised. Although my final code didn't show it, I experimented with this before abandoning the idea and finding a more straightforward option.

- Alternative solution
  I'm aware of a solution to the collapsible using Grid. I wanted to learn to utilise JS which is why I took my final approach but I may come back to this challenge and complete it using Grid so that I gain familiarity with both approaches. 

### Continued development

- Further projects using JS 
  I want to continue to push the limits of my knowledge, knowing that I will struggle but that it can be overcome. 
  I feel that I can utilise AI tools to helps accelerate this learning. I want to spend time learning the logic of how something is constructed rather than remembering the specific code. 

- CSS Styling
  I want to find projects to push my styling abilities and better reflect challenges that I will see in the real world.
